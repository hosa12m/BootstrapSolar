Changes from original design:

* Inputs via two 2.1mm DC jacks (vs one 1.3mm jack and USB)
* Both inputs protected by diodes (vs only one)
* Fast charge current pre-configured to 1000mA (vs 500mA)
* JST jacks replaced with vertical insertion types 

TODO:
* Replace 4700uF cap with two 2200uF SMD capacitors in parallel
* Replace THERM with actual thermistor, and set R4/R5 to set temp range to -20 ~ 60C
